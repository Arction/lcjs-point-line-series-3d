# LightningChart<sup>&#174;</sup> JS 3D Line and Point Series real-time performance showcase

This repository is a showcase for rendering a rapidly streaming 3D dataset (up to more than 100 kHz) as a set of points or connected lines.

For 2D applications and more chart examples, please refer to our full [examples set][1].

Hardware accelerated rendering with *WebGL* enables applications that require rendering of massively complex data sets, or as in this case, large data sets that are updated at extremely high speed.

## Performance benchmarks

Performance in real-time application is measured as the speed at which data can be streamed (points / second, or signal frequency Hz) while keeping a stable frame rate of 60 FPS (frames per second) and a smooth user experience for interacting with the chart.

Example: Feature A can handle input data from 60 kHz stream.

All input data is rendered without exception (no downsampling).

### Measurement machines:

1)	Low end PC A (Lenovo Yoga 530):
    - CPU: Intel i7-8550U 1.80 GHz
    - GPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620
    - RAM: 8 GB
    - Display: 1920 x 1080, 60 Hz

2)	High end PC A:
    - CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X 3.80 GHz
    - GPU: GeForce RTX 2070 (EVGA XC Ultra Gaming, 8GB GDDR6)
    - RAM: 16 GB DDR4 @ 3200 MHz
    - Display: 1440P 144Hz monitor.

All measurements were recorded in Google Chrome.

### Point Series 3D

Each data point (x, y, z) coordinate is rendered as a detailed sphere geometry.

-	Low end PC A: 6 000 points / second (equivalent of 6 kHz signal)
-	High end PC A: **108 000 points / second** (equivalent of 108 kHz signal)

Note, how the data rendering speed greatly benefits from having a strong GPU.

If *even faster* streaming speeds are required, then a *Point Cloud Series 3D* can be used to render the same data without 3D geometry for maximum performance:

-	Low end PC A: **65 000 points / second** (equivalent of 65 kHz signal)
-	High end PC A: **504 000 points / second** (equivalent of 504 kHz signal)

### Line Series 3D

Active set of data points (x, y, z) coordinates is rendered as a continuous high detail line geometry.

![line geometry](line-geometry.PNG)

-	Low end PC A: 1 500 points / second (equivalent of 1.5 kHz signal)
-	High end PC A: **67 000 points / second** (equivalent of 67 kHz signal)
